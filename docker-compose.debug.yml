# The way Docker Compose handles the different build environments -- say, 
# development and production -- is to have completely separate .yml files for 
# each environment.  The different .yml files would then reference different
# config files and use different command-line switches and so forth to
# differentiate the builds.  So in theory you wouldn't have to, for example,
# edit any config files when you want to switch between doing a build for dev
# or production -- you just run a different compose.yml file.
#
# VS Code's Docker plugin auto-generated two .yml files for me, to implement two
# types of build: the "normal" docker-compose.yml file, which I have heavily 
# modified and which is in active use; and this "debug" flavor.  I have not yet
# mentally parsed what the heck this file is trying to do.  Presumably it's so
# you can run a Flask app in a debugger.  Maybe?
#
# In any case we are definitely not using it yet.  I'm just keeping it around in 
# case it turns out to be useful.
