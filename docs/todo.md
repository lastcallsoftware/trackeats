In no particular order:
- Set up issue tracking in Jira or GitHub so I don't have to keep this list in a text file!
- Look into deploying MySQL in a Docker container
- Look into how to start the DB server automaticaly when the EC2 server starts
- Figure out how to do CI/CD with GitHub Actions (or Jenkins)
- Research and set up login security on the front end
- Research and set up secret management on the back end
- Get an SSL certificate and set it up on the server!
